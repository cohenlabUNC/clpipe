===================
Postprocessing
===================


When performing functional connectivity analysis, there are several additional 
processing steps that need to be taken after the minimal preprocessing of fMRIPrep. 
clpipe implements these steps in Python, and a fMRIprep preprocessed dataset can 
be postprocessed using the following command:

.. click:: clpipe.cli:fmri_postprocess_cli
	:prog: fmri_postprocess
	:nested: full



Processing Checker
------------------

clpipe has a convenient function for determining which scans successfully made it 
through both preprocessing using fMRIprep and postprocessing.

This command will create a csv file listing all scans found in the BIDS dataset, 
and corresponding scans in the fMRIprep dataset and the postprocessed dataset.

For a description of the various postprocessing steps, along with references,
please see the following documentation:

1. Nuisance Regression
2. Frequency Filtering
3. Scrubbing
4. Spectral Interpolation

.. click:: clpipe.fmri_process_check:fmri_process_check
	:prog: fmri_process_check
	:nested: full


SUSAN Spatial Smoothing
------------------


clpipe uses FSL's `SUSAN smoothing <https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/SUSAN>`_ 
to perform spatial smoothing. This step is usually done after postprocessing. 
Options for this are configurable on a processing stream basis, 
see config file for more details.

.. click:: clpipe.susan_smoothing:susan_smoothing
	:prog: susan_smoothing
	:nested: full


fmri_postprocess2
------------------

New to clpipe v1.5, the command fmri_postprocess2 combines the functionality
of fmri_postprocess and glm_setup into a unified postprocessing stream.

This command allows for flexible creation of processing streams. The order of
processing steps and their specific implementations can be modified in the
configuration file. Any temporally-relevant processing steps can also be
applied to each image's corresponding confounds file.
fmri_postprocess2 caches its processing intermediaries
in a working directory, which allows quick re-runs of pipelines with 
new parameters.

This command will also output a detailed processing graph
for each processing stream.

Available processing steps:

	- Temporal Filtering
	- Intensity Normalization
	- Spatial Smoothing
	- AROMA Regression
	- Confound Regression
	- Apply Mask
	- Resample
	- Trim Timepoints

.. click:: clpipe.fmri_postprocess2:fmri_postprocess2_cli
	:prog: fmri_postprocess2
	:nested: full

Configuration Setup
===================

This command requires a new configuration block - if you using an existing
clpipe project, you will have to insert this json into your configuration file.
Otherwise, this block will be included when running "project setup."

Processing Streams Setup
===================

By default, the output from running fmri_postprocess2 will appear in your
clpipe folder at data_postproc2/smooth_filter_normalize, reflecting the
defaults from PostProcessingOptions2.

However, you can utilize the power of processing streams to deploy multiple
postprocessing streams. Each processing stream you define your config file's 
ProcessingStreams block will create a new output folder named 
after the ProcessingStream setting.

Within each processing stream, you can override any of the settings in the main
PostProcessingOptions2 section. For example, in the follow json snippet,
the first processing stream will only pick "rest" tasks and defines its
own set of processing steps. The second stream does the same thing, but
specifies a filtering high pass by overriding the default value of -1 with
.009. 

.. code-block:: json

	...
	"ProcessingStreams": [
		...
		{
			"ProcessingStream": "smooth_aroma-regress_filter-butterworth_normalize",
			"PostProcessingOptions": {
				"TargetTasks": [
					"rest"
				],
				"ProcessingSteps": [
					"SpatialSmoothing",
					"AROMARegression",
					"TemporalFiltering",
					"IntensityNormalization",
					"ApplyMask"
				]
			}
		},
		{
			"ProcessingStream": "smooth_aroma-regress_filter-high-only_normalize",
			"PostProcessingOptions": {
				"TargetTasks": [
					"rest"
				],
				"ProcessingSteps": [
					"SpatialSmoothing",
					"AROMARegression",
					"TemporalFiltering",
					"IntensityNormalization",
					"ApplyMask"
				],
				"ProcessingStepOptions": {
					"TemporalFiltering": {
						"FilteringHighPass": .009
					}
				}
			}
		},
	...

To run a specific stream, give the -processing_stream stream option
of fmri_postprocess2 the name of the stream:

.. code-block:: console

	fmri_postprocess2 -config_file clpipe_config.json -processing_stream smooth_aroma-regress_filter-butterworth_normalize -submit
