Most command line functions in clpipe can take a configuration file in the '-configFile' option. These configuration files are JSONs that contain all aspects of the preprocessing and postprocessing streams that you want applied to your dataset. To create a configuration file for your dataset use the following command

.. code-block:: console

    get_config_file -outputFile <adirectory/yourfilename>.json

This command will create a default configuration file with whatever name you specified. The default configuration file looks like this

.. code-block :: json

All of these fields are required and have what the designers of clpipe consider to be reasonable defaults for processing. Additionally, users at UNC-CH on the Longleaf cluster with access to the HNG group should be able to use the default options with no change. Other users will have to modify several fields. We describe the various sections of the config now.
